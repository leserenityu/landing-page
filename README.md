This was a project that I did from The Odin Project.
I practiced the HTML and CSS skills that I have learned, but I had trouble with the flexbox.
I did not follow any specific sizing and did an estimation on measurements that I did not know.

Following projects, I will follow a tip from a web designer:<br>
<strong>Go by the 8-point system for sizing.</strong>
